## Architecture
model.py: The definition of the model class.

utils.py: Some tools for network training and testing.

data.py: Preparation tools for the training dataset.

test.py: Quick dehazing test for hazy images.

testall.py: Dehazing test for all hazy images dataset.

train.py: Training the dehazing model by supervised learning.

SemiStrain.py: Training the dehazing model by Semi-supervised learning in specific dataset.

## Test
1. Please put the images to be tested into the ``test_images`` folder. We have prepared the images of the experimental results in the paper.
2. Please run the ``test.py``, then you will get the following results:

## Test all
If you want to test the results on a labeled dataset such as [O-HAZE](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire18//o-haze/) , you can go through the following procedure:
1. Please put the dataset to be tested into the ``test0`` folder. You need put the hazy images into the ``test0/hazy`` folder, and put the clear images into the ``test0/gt`` folder. We have prepared the dataset of the experimental results in the paper.
2. Please run the ``testall.py``, then you will get the dehazing results SSIM, PSNR, and Inference time.

## Train
You can perform supervised learning of the network by following this step.
1. Please put the dataset into the ``train_data`` folder. You can get the [RESIDE](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets) for training.
2. Please run the ``train.py``, then you will get the dehazing model in ``saved_models`` folder.
