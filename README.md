## Our work
In this manuscript, we propose a new Object-Aware Region Enhancement (OARE) method to improve object detection in harsh environments.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.8.1 + cu111
* torchvision 0.9.1 + cu111
* numpy
* opencv-python
* skimage
* hiddenlayer
* matplotlib
* PIL
* math
* os
  
## Architecture
model.py: The definition of the model class.

utils.py: Some tools for network training and testing.

data.py: Preparation tools for the training dataset.

test.py: Quick detection test for harsh images.

testall.py: Detection test for all harsh images dataset.

train.py: Training the dehazing model.

## Test
1. Please put the images to be tested into the ``test_images`` folder. We have prepared the images of the experimental results in the paper.
2. Please run the ``test.py``, then you will get the following results for OARE:

## Test all
If you want to test the results on a labeled dataset such as [M3FD](https://github.com/JinyuanLiu-CV/TarDAL), you can go through the following procedure:
1. Please put the dataset to be tested into the ``test0`` folder.
2. Please run the ``testall.py``, then you will get the detection results mAP50 and Inference time.

## Other codes will be updated soon
